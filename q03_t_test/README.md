# Hypothesis testing using t-test

In the class we tested if house prices in OldTown is different than the mean price. Lets now check if the Living Area (`GrLivArea`) is significantly different than the mean `GrLivArea` area of the population.

>Null Hypothesis: The mean of Living area of houses in OldTown is the same as the population mean.

> Alternate Hypothesis: The mean of Living area of houses in OldTown is different than the population mean.

Test the above hypothesis at 95% significance level and return True if we reject the null hypothesis.
